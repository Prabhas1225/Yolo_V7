YOLO V7

This repository contains the end to end code to train a object detection model using YOLO v7. For the purpose of this project, I have used american sign language dataset which was available in roboflow. The training was done in Google Colab. The train model is further integrated in a [nextjs app](https://github.com/Prabhas1225/Sign-Language-Detection-Using-Yolov7) using Flask.
